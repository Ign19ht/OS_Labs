FCFS:
    Each process will be completed.
    The waiting time depends on the arrival time, the later the process arrives, the longer it will wait.
SJF:
    Since the shortest process is running, the longest process may not be executed at all.
    But short processes have a chance to be executed immediately, thus increasing the total number of executed processes.
Round Robin:
    All processes have the same priority, which allows short processes to execute faster, but for long ones it is not so simple.
    If the quantum is too large, then the algorithm will not differ from FCFS, if the quantum is too small, then the processor efficiency decreases.
