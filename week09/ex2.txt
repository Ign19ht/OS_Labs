To increase the number of hits, it is necessary that the same sequence references appear NO later than N, where N is the cache size.
For example:
If N = 5:
    1 2 3 1 4 2 3 5; where 1, 2, 3 appeared when they are still in the cache.
If N = 7:
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
And vice versa, To increase the number of hits, it is necessary that the same sequence references appear LATER than N, where N is the cache size.
For example:
If N = 5:
    1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6, each element appear only after that moment when it was moved from the cache
